## The Main VPC Site Has The Following Configuration:
	□ CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
	□ Region: us-east-1 (North Virginia, closest to Boston, where the simulated hospital is located)
	□ Enable DNS hostnames and DNS resolution
	
	□ Main VPC Site: Public Subnet Contains :
		§ ONLY for the internet-facing load balancers and NAT gateways. This separates the part of the network receiving public traffic from sensitive resources
		§ One subnet per AZ (3 AZs)
		§ IP Ranges: 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24

	□ Main VPC Site: Private Application Subnet Contains:
		§ Cerner EHR servers & clinical applications
		§ One subnet per AZ (3 AZs)
		§ CIDR range suggestion: 10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24
			
	□ Main VPC Site: Private Database Subnets:
		§ For the database servers and storage of sensitive data
		§ One subnet per AZ (3 AZs)
		§ AZ Ranges: 10.0.20.0/24, 10.0.21.0/24, 10.0.22.0/24


## The DR site VPC Has The Following Configuration:
	□ CIDR: 10.1.0.0/16
	□ Region us-east-2 (Ohio)
	□ Enable DNS
	□ Public Subnets:
		§ ONLY for the internet-facing load balancers and NAT gateways. This separates the part of the network receiving public traffic from sensitive resources
		§ One subnet per AZ
		§ DR VPC Public AZ ranges: 10.1.0.0/24, 10.1.1.0/24, 10.1.2.0/24
	
	○ DR Site Application Subnet:
		§ For the Cerner EHR servers & clinical applications
		§ One subnet per AZ
		§ CIDR range suggestion: 10.1.10.0/24, 10.1.11.0/24, 10.1.12.0/24
				
	○ DR Site Database Subnets:
		§ For the database servers and storage of sensitive data
		§ One subnet per AZ
		§ CIDR range suggestion: 10.1.20.0/24, 10.1.21.0/24, 10.1.22.0/24
			
	○ Backup Admin Subnets:
		§ The DR site contains an extra subnet that holds the backup management servers. 
			- This is to save costs, as opposed to building an entirely new VPC for just the management site backups.
		§ For administrative servers and tools and monitoring systems like:
			□ Domain controllers for AD services
			□ Admin jump servers that the IT team uses to manage other systems securely
			□ System Admin tools like the management servers, patch management systems, and ITSM tools that track and manage IT incidents across the network
			□ Backup management servers and consoles like those that manage the on-prem backups during the migration, and cloud-based backups after the migration
		§ One subnet per AZ
		§ CIDR range suggestion: 10.1.30.0/24, 10.1.31.0/24, 10.1.32.0/24




## The Management Site VPC Has The Following Configuration:
	□ VPC CIDR: 10.2.0.0/16
    □ Enable DNS
    □ Region: us-east-1 (North Virginia, to reduce latency in connecting for server management)
	 □ Deployed in 2 AZs: Since the Management VPC is not hosting patient-facing workloads, 2 AZs are sufficient
		○ Public Subnet:
			§ Has Internet Gateway to manage traffic for server updates, etc. (Connects public route tables in both AZs)
			§ Has a NAT gateway for outgoing traffic
			§ Subnet is 10.2.0.0/24
			
		○ Private Admin Subnets:
			§ For administrative servers and monitoring systems like:
				□ Domain controllers for AD services
				□ Admin jump servers that the IT team uses to manage other systems securely
				□ System Admin tools like the management servers, patch management systems, and ITSM tools that track and manage IT incidents across the network
				□ Backup management servers and consoles like those that manage the on-prem backups during the migration, and cloud-based backups after the migration
			§ IP Range for the private subnet:
					□  10.2.10.0/24
		

## Outpatient Clinic:
	□ On-prem location
	□ Holds Local App & DB Servers, Network Equipment, And Imaging Machines
		○ Servers:
			□ 2 servers handling core apps (limited version of EHR)
		○ Network:
			□ A router, switch, and firewall
		○ Workstations:
			□ For clinical staff
		○ Medical devices:
			□ Blood pressure monitors
			□ Scales
			□ X-ray
			□  Ultrasound
	□ Connects to transit gateway:
			
			
## Two Satellite Locations:
	□ On-prem locations
	□ Connects to Transit Gateway (And Cloud VPCs) using Transit Gateway:
	□ Hold Local App, DB, and Imaging Servers			
	□ The 2 satellite locations need to access the following within AWS:
		§ Cerner EHRs app
		§ App DB
		§ Send monitoring data to CloudWatch
			□ Install CloudWatch agents on the on-prem servers
		§ Stored backups of the on-prem servers within AWS
	○ Network Infrastructure:
		§ Internal switches
		§ Firewalls
		§ Local DNS servers
	    § Servers (Compute):
			○ Local app servers
			○ Local DB servers
			○ File servers
			○ Print servers
			○ Local domain controllers
			○ Workstations:
					□ Used by clinical staff to access the EHR System
			○ Administrative workstations:
					□ Used by the admin staff for tasks like scheduling, billing, and other admin functions
			○ Medical Devices (Imaging):
