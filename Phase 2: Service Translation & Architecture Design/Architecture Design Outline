	## Phase 2: Service Translation & Architecture Design
      This phase builds on phase 1 and focuses on mapping the operational needs to select the best-suited services from the many that AWS offers.
	## VPC Creation:
					□ The goal to ensure strong network isolation and management, so there will be 3 VPC's for:
						◊ The main hospital site 
						◊ The management site
						◊ The DR site
				  □ On-Prem Locations:
				  	◊ Outpatient Clinic
					  ◊ Satellite location 1
					  ◊ Satellite location 2



	## Services To Use 
       □ Connecting The Cloud Environment To The On-Prem Locations:
			- Both the VPC's and on-prem sites will all be linked AWS Transit Gateway
			- Why AWS Transit Gateway?
				◊ It provides consistent network design which makes for easier network management
				◊ Uniform security configuration
				◊ Designed for architectures that demand low-latency & demand high-security
				◊ Higher cost compared to site-to-site VPN but is more reliable

		□ To manage the on-prem servers and update them via SSH:
			  ◊ Use AWS Systems Manager
              ◊ The SSH protocol is chose as it can be disabled when maintenance is completed on the sever

		□ For automated data transfer between on-prem and AWS services like S3AWS DataSync:
			 ◊ For automated data transfer between on-prem and AWS services like S3
			
        □ For Monitoring & Alerts:
			◊ Setup CloudWatch agents on the on-prem and cloud servers
					
        □ IAM:
			◊ Needs to be combined with on-premises AD to allow access to the cloud resources
