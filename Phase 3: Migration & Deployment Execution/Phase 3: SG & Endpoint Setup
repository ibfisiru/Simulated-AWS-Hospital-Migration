## Setup Security Groups & VPC Endpoints:
		A) For the Public Subnet:
			§ Inbound Rules:
				□ From Load balancer (0.0.0.0/0)
					• TCP 443: HTTPS traffic for secure web access to applications and services
					
				□ From Admin Servers (ONLY IF AWS Systems Manager is not Setup)
					• Setup SSH in the meantime
					
				□ For Load Balancer Health Checks:
					• Rule to allow inbound TCP traffic  on port used by health checks:
						◊ Port:
				□ DNS:
					• Allow traffic out of port 53 for DNS resolutions/App dependencies 
				
			§ Outbound Rules:
				□ To Application Subnet (10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24)
					• TCP 443: HTTPS traffic to application servers
					• Custom application ports required by Cerner
				□ Monitoring & Logging:
					• Allow traffic to AWS service endpoints like CloudWatch Logs, AWS config, and S3 for storage of logs
				
			
			
		B) For the Private App Subnets:
			§ Inbound Rules:
					
				□ From Administrative Subnet (10.0.30.0/24, 10.0.31.0/24, 10.0.32.0/24):
					• TCP 22: SSH access for Linux server management
					• TCP 3389: RDP access for Windows server management
					• HTTPS: from admin SG
					
				□ From DB Tier:
					• 1521
				
			
			§ Outbound Rules:
				□ To Internet (via NAT Gateway):
					• TCP 443: HTTPS for system updates and patches
					• TCP/UDP 53: DNS queries
				□ To Database Subnet (10.0.20.0/24, 10.0.21.0/24, 10.0.22.0/24):
					• TCP 1521: Oracle database primary connections
					• TCP 1526: Oracle SQL*Net listener
				□ To Administrative Subnet (10.0.30.0/24, 10.0.31.0/24, 10.0.32.0/24):
					• HTTPS to Admin SG
					• SSH to Admin SG
					• RDP to Admin SG


		C) For the Private Management Subnet:
			§ The administrative subnet must accept incoming traffic from authorized sources:
				• VPN or AWS Client VPN connections for secure remote access by IT staff
				• AWS Systems Manager endpoints for secure systems management
				• Return traffic from managed resources in other subnets
			§ For Outbound:
				• Access to application subnet for system management and monitoring
				• Access to database subnet for database administration
				• Access to internet via NAT Gateway strictly for patching and update traffic
				• Communication with AWS services for management and monitoring
			
			§ Inbound Rules:
				• From VPN/Remote Access (Client VPN Endpoint):
					• TCP 443: HTTPS for secure remote access (Use VPC CIDR)
					
					• TCP 22: SSH connections from authorized administrators(Use VPC CIDR)
					
					• TCP 3389: RDP connections from authorized administrators (Use VPC CIDR)
				
			§ Outbound Rules:
				• To Application Subnet (10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24):
					• TCP 443: HTTPS for application monitoring
				• To Database Subnet (10.0.20.0/24, 10.0.21.0/24, 10.0.22.0/24):
					• TCP 1521: Oracle database management
				• To Internet (via NAT Gateway):
					• TCP 443: HTTPS for system updates and management tools
					• 53: DNS queries
					
				• To AWS Services (Through VPC Endpoints):
					• TCP 443: Access to AWS Systems Manager
					• TCP 443: Access to AWS CloudWatch
					• TCP 443: Access to other AWS management services
				• To The VPC Endpoints:
					• HTTPS
					• Destination is the AD and Admin subnets (those attached to the VPC)
		
		D) For The Private DB Subnet:
			§ DB Inbound Rules:
				1) Allow Oracle traffic from application tier
					• Type: Oracle-RDS (TCP 1521)
					• Source: Application subnet CIDR ranges (10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24)
					• Description: Allow Oracle traffic from application tier
				2) Allow Admin Access
					• Type: TCP (TCP 1521)
					• Source: Management subnet CIDR ranges (10.0.30.0/24, 10.0.31.0/24, 10.0.32.0/24)
					• Description: Allow traffic from admin servers
			§ DB Outbound Rules:
				□ Outbound rules are configured to use security groups instead of entire CIDR ranges for security reasons
				1)  Allow HTTPS traffic to Internet:
					• Type: Custom TCP 443
					• Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 via nat gateway
				2) Allow DNS querying
					• Type: Custom TCP/UDP 53
					• Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
					• Description: Allow DNS resolution
		
		E) Configure VPC Endpoints:
			§ Since this architecture is following zero-trust principals, resources in the private subnet need a way to connect to other AWS services like S3 and Systems Manager. VPC Endpoints are used to do this while allowing the instance to remain private from internet access:
				• Systems Manager Needs 3 Endpoints:
					• ssm endpoint: Allows the instance to communicate with Systems Manager service
					• ssmmessages endpoint: Enables Session Manager to establish the connection
					• ec2messages endpoint: Handles command and control communications between Systems Manager and the instance
					
				• For Each Systems Manager Endpoint:
					• For the Subnets:
						◊ The admin subnets in the 3 AZ's
					• For the SG's:
						The admin and AD security groups
